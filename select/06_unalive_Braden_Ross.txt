I wanna die
No, not literally, fuck
Just wanna cry
'Cause I hate the way I look
I'll realign my spine and hide inside the bassline
Anything I can do to feel unalive
(Is it really you?)
'Cause I'm a robot
With human skin
And try as I might
I can't overwrite the code within
I'm just a robot
I don't exist
Extinguished the light
I gave up the fight
For views and clicks
But somehow I still break down every time you call
I'm just a fake now, not supposed to feel at all
So why am I so unsteady
Fused with so much pain already
Yeah I wish I could just start again
No pretend
But everyday I look inside with discontent
Shit doesn't relent
See pop shows near Clarkston
Get tickets as low as $76

I wanna die
No, not literally, fuck
Just wanna cry
'Cause I hate the way I look
I'll realign my spine and hide inside the bassline
Find the shrine confined within, embrace mine
You can't contrive
To remove me from the book
Blood intertwined
Art, virality mistook
I'll realign my spine and hide inside the bassline
Anything I can do to feel unalive
They make this shit look easy
Hijack their eyes to feed me
He'll reach inside of their souls' convince them that they need me
But what's the meaning
I'm bleeding
I feel my life force depleting
So what's the point of succeeding
If it's not for myself?
It's just for everyone else
Couldn't help but put my pride on the shelf
I guess I'm going to hell
We're all frauds, ain't no contest
(Ain't no contest)
I'm no god, just a complex
(Just a complex)
I don't get it
How they hid it
So well
(And I don't wanna die but maybe its easier)
It's no fun, to be broken
Burning sun, I'm unchosen
They don't get it
How I did it
Don't tell
I tried to bottle it up
But you threw salt in the cut
My body's turning to rust
I guess I'll wallow in it
They said it wasn't enough
So now I'm calling their bluff
Not who they think that I was
I strive to keep it hidden
I wanna die
No not literally, fuck
Just wanna cry
'Cause I hate the way I look
I'll realign my spine and hide inside the bassline
Find the shrine confined within, embrace mine
You can't contrive
To remove me from the book
Blood intertwined
Art, virality mistook
I'll realign my spine and hide inside the bassline
Anything I can do to feel unalive
