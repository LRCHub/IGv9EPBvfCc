It starts with just a thought within
A wish that rode on mellow wind
Begins and ends with “hello” and “goodbye”
I'll take a chance to see what we could be
The past in distant memory to another world
At last, I'll grasp that promised life
But the high is over sooner than it began
Stay alive and sober, all a part of the plan
I arrived a soldier in a far-off land
With a four-leaf clover in this scarred right hand (You can)
Over and over, rewrite
Felt the closure with every night
So you're gonna go and let it all melt away
Into that formless storm of white?
On the winds of desperation flying
For all this world to see
Though I make do all despite it, fate is hard to hide
It's always been decided for me
Numbing pain is numbing happiness
Something anyone can find
Pushing on for resolve that is mine
Alone
It's hopeless, though this soul can say I tried
To move forward, the lore is I must
Be void inside
Recalling all the days we met
A place that I belonged, and yet
My world was built of walls of endless height
But it was melody that set me free
"This world ain't seen the best of me"
I'm invincible, for just one moment, I can fight
Not hesitant, fast-paced hot to cold
I found a present, past, future in store being sold
Unpleasant, resentment, the more you're told
Deep inside of the binds of stories of old
Burning through every page
Keep you learning to envy the stage
All the while, with a vile and discerning smile
I'm planning how I'm gonna break the cage
On winds of desperation flying
For all this world to see
Though I make do all despite it, fate is hard to hide
It's always been decided for me
Numbing tears and heartache, sorrow, hate
Running endlessly through time again
Still deprived, unalive, like I've always been
My home
A place I'll never know until I’m satisfied
To move forward, the lore is I must
Be void inside
The soul is divided, colder inside, the dice, roll is decisive
Must have it nice, a gorgeous device, to trick and entice, it’s got a price
Playing it straight, the cards I create, a heart's nothing but dead weight
Diamonds or spades, the lies and charades, they never gonna change
Lie to myself, reject any and all help, betting all of my chips, let 'em fall to hell
Blood, sweat cannot stop the thoughts invading, "nobody’s waiting"
After all is said and done, there’s nowhere left to run
Forget the sun, rest in peace and appease the beast
Never thought I'd beg the Beats to cease
Talking head rotting I don’t gotta be whole
Don't want a dead body, don't need no soul (Take Control)
Our world is turning once again
For that reason, I still sing
And we've shed so many tears by now
Though I'd never dare to change a thing
Days of laughing and crying, feeling like dying
All became a part of me
We won't have to wait for long, waiting from beyond
What more could there be?
Numbing pain is numbing happiness
Something anyone can find
Pushing on, for resolve that's truly mine
On the winds of desperation flying
For all this world to see
Though I make do all despite it, fate is hard to hide
I won't let it decide who I'll be
Numbing pain is numbing happiness
Though you know it’s all worth fighting for
Every means to an end is an open door
Your home
Is more than just a place you're never satisfied
I'll move forward toward something rewarding
By your orders, I'll never be soaring
I'm ignoring the lore 'cause I won't be void inside
もう戻れない
In death, I'm somehow more alive
