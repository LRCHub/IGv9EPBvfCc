How can I be wise
To realize when you're alive
No where in your eye
Is a likeness of a shadow

Have we woken up?
Will the words you haven't spoken
Leave me on the side
Of a mountain
In the open

I've been waiting for
What I built before
To come undone under the storm

I've been waiting on
What I killed before
To come alive under the storm
